## Introduction

Welcome to the **AI Dialogue Memory Based on Hidden State** repository. This project aims to enhance artificial intelligence's memory capabilities through a combination of transformer encoders and LSTM decoders. By preserving state information, we strive to create AI that can remember previous interactions, thus improving the quality and relevance of its responses.

- **Transformer Encoder**: Utilizes a transformer encoder to process input sequences effectively.
- **LSTM Decoder**: Employs an LSTM decoder for generating human-like responses.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Focused on NLP tasks, making it suitable for various applications.
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Built on PyTorch, ensuring robust performance and flexibility.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lhoffart/AI-Dialogue-Memory-Based-on-Hidden-State.git
   cd AI-Dialogue-Memory-Based-on-Hidden-State
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can create a virtual environment for this project.

## Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. **Load the model**:
   ```python
   import torch
   from model import YourModelClass

   model = YourModelClass.load_model('path/to/model')
   ```

2. **Input data**:
   Prepare your input in the required format:
   ```python
   input_data = "Your input text here."
   ```

3. **Generate a response**:
   ```python
   response = model.generate_response(input_data)
   print(response)
   ```

## Model Architecture

The architecture of this model combines both transformer and LSTM components to maximize performance. Below is a simplified diagram of the architecture:

```
Input Sequence → Transformer Encoder → LSTM Decoder → Output Sequence
```

- **Transformer Encoder**: Captures contextual information and relationships within the input sequence.
- **LSTM Decoder**: Generates output sequences while maintaining memory of previous states.

### Components

1. **Transformer Layer**: Utilizes self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in the input.
2. **LSTM Layer**: Processes sequences of data, maintaining information over long periods.

## Training

Training the model involves several steps:

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Ensure your data is clean and formatted correctly.
2. **Set hyperparameters**: Define learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
3. **Train the model**:
   ```python
   for epoch in range(num_epochs):
       for batch in data_loader:
           optimizer.zero_grad()
           output = model(batch)
           loss = loss_function(output, target)
           loss.backward()
           optimizer.step()
   ```

4. **Save the model**:
   ```python
   torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
   ```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance:

1. **Load the trained model**:
   ```python
   model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
   ```

2. **Evaluate on test data**:
   Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to understand the model's performance.
